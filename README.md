## 🔐 Automated Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) Process


Welcome to my first automated Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) process! This project is designed to streamline vulnerability detection and security assessments, ensuring systems are robust and secure against potential threats. Whether you're a developer, cybersecurity enthusiast, or IT professional, this guide will walk you through the steps I took to automate VAPT for efficient and accurate results.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the VAPT process by integrating various tools and techniques to identify, analyze, and report security vulnerabilities in a system. It leverages Bridged Network Mode for seamless testing, ensuring both external and internal vulnerabilities are thoroughly examined.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Nmap: Network scanning and host discovery
Nikto: Web server vulnerability scanning
OWASP ZAP: Automated web app security testing
Metasploit: Penetration testing framework
Burp Suite: Intercepting proxy for advanced web app testing
Python/Bash Scripts: Automating repetitive tasks and reporting
⚙️ Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-vapt.git
cd automated-vapt
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required tools installed:

- bash
- Copy
- Edit
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install nmap nikto metasploit-framework zaproxy burpsuite python3
- Configure Network
- Set up Bridged Network Mode in your VM settings to allow external and internal scanning.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. Network Scanning:
Using Nmap to detect open ports and services.

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -A target_ip

2. Vulnerability Scanning:
Automated scanning with Nikto and OWASP ZAP.

bash
Copy
Edit
nikto -h http://target_ip
zaproxy -daemon -quickurl http://target_ip

3. Penetration Testing:
Utilizing Metasploit to exploit detected vulnerabilities.

bash
Copy
Edit
msfconsole -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD; run"

4. Report Generation:
Python scripts automatically compile findings into a comprehensive report.

## 📊 Sample Results
After running the automated process, you'll receive reports detailing:

Detected vulnerabilities (CVEs)
Exploitable services and weaknesses
Suggested remediations and fixes

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
